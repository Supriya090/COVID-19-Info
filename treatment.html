                If you have mild symptoms, your doctor may recommend that you recover at home. You may be asked to 
                isolate yourself as much as possible from family and pets while you're sick and to use a separate 
                bedroom and bathroom. Your doctor will likely recommend that you stay home for a period of time except

                    Since coronavirus was first discovered as the causative agent of COVID-19, scientists have been 
                    racing to get a better understanding of the virus' genetic makeup and unravel how to effectively 
                    treat infections. As of April 6, more than 200 clinical trials of COVID-19 treatments or vaccines 
                    that are either ongoing or recruiting patients.  The drugs being tested range from repurposed flu 
                    treatments to failed ebola drugs, to malaria treatments that were first developed decades ago.
